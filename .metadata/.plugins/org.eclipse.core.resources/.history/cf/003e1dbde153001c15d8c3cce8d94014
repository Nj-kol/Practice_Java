# Hash Table

## Load Factor

* Tells us how full a hash table is
* Load factor = # of items / capacity ( or size / capacity )
* Load factor is used to decided when to resize the array backing the hash table
* Don't want the Load factor to be 
  - too low (lots of empty space)
  - too high (will increase the likekihood of collisions)
* Can play a role in determining the tiome complexity of retieval
