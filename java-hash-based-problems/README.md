# Hash Table

## Load Factor

* Tells us how full a hash table is
* Load factor = # of items / capacity (or size / capacity)
* Load factor is used to decided when to resize the array backing the hash table
* Don't want the Load factor to be too low (lots of empty space)
* Don't want the Load factor to be too high (will increase the likelihood of collisions)
* Can play a role in determining the time complexity for retrieval

# Collision Resolution

1. Open Addressing

## Linear Probing
