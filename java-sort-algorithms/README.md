# Sort Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is a stable algorithm

## Selection Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is called a Selection sort, because on each traversal we are selecting the largest value and moving it to the sorted partition
* It is an unstable algorithm

## Insertion Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is a stable algorithm

## Shell Sort

* It is a variation of Insertion Sort
* Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959. Hence the name.
* The algorithm does some preliminary work (Using gap values greater than 1),and then becomes Insertion sort
* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* Worst-case performance- O(N^2).The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants, determining their time complexity remains an open problem.
* It is an unstable algorithm
