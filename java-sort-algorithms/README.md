# Sort Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is a stable algorithm

## Selection Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is called a Selection sort, because on each traversal we are selecting the largest value and moving it to the sorted partition
* It is an unstable algorithm

## Insertion Sort

* It is an *in-place* algorithm
* O(N^2) time complexity - Quadratic 
* It is a stable algorithm
