# Recursion

* Recursion occurs when a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a specified stopping condition. Such a function is called a recursive function.
* The code is simpler and shorter than an iterative code
* For a recursive function, you only need to define two things :
  1. the base case ( aka breaking condition )
  2. the recursive case

* When this base case is met, we say that recursion starts to *unwind*
* Recursion is most useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks.

## Tail recursion 

* The Java compiler does not use tail recursion

# Notes

* There can be more than one base case
